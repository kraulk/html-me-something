					<h3 class="sub-head">Bachelor of Science</h3>
					<p class="sub-text">&quot;Go gators!&quot; I atteded the University of Florida (UF) for my Bachelors of Science (B.S.) degree in psychology from 2008-2012. I have a passion for mental health, executive funcitoning, and behavior analysis. While pursuing my degree, I got to experience the joys of a national championship in college football. The professionals made it big, but I was satisfied with playing intramural soccer and flag football, myself. The education bug bit me while taking some elective courses and I ended up double-minoring in Education and Florida Teaching. I wanted to be a school psychologist and knew my journey as a lifelong learner was just beginning.</p>

					<h3 class="sub-head">Education Specialist</h3>
					<p class="sub-text">I went to graduate school at UF to get my Education Specialist (Ed.S.) degree in school psychology from 2012-2015. Graduate school was hard work but left me with a lot of knowledge and practical experience. I attended and presented at multiple state and national conferences in school psychology. My first year I worked as a graduate assitant for a large class with 30 undergraduate teaching assistants. My second year I was a graduate research assistant developing an emotion regulation/executive function curriculum for middle school students with significant behavioral difficulties. I obtained real-world school psychology experience through practicum in Alachua and Marion counties. And in my third year I completed a full year internship with Pinellas County Schools. Upon completion of my degree, I obtained the high-level certification of Nationally Certified School Psychologist in addition to my Florida Department of Education certification as a Certified School Psychologist.</p>

					<h3 class="sub-head">Okaloosa County Schools, Florida</h3>
					<p class="sub-text">In Okaloosa County I provided school psychological services to four elementary schools and helped in the early identification of pre-school children with disabilities needing extra support. In addition to providing psycho-educational evaluations for schools, I worked with administrative teams to improve school-wide academic and behavioral systems known as Multi-Tiered Systems of Support and data-based problem solving. I left my role in this organization to pursue my goals of providing more comprehensive psychological services in schools.</p>

					<h3 class="sub-head">Pinellas County Schools, Florida</h3>
					<p class="sub-text">I returned to Pinellas County Schools for a case-load (two schools) that allowed me to provide more comprehensive school psychological services. The foundation of these services come from diversity in development and learning; research and program evaluation; and legal, ethical, and professional practice. Throughout all aspects of service delivery, I provided consultation and collaboration and data-based decision-making and accountability. I provided direct and indirect services to children, families, and schools through intervention and instructional support to develop academic skills, as well as intervention and mental health services to develop social and life skills. At the systems level, I advocated for school-wide practices to promote learning, preventive and reponsive services, and family-school collaboration.</p>
					<p class="sub-text">After a year, I obtained an additional role managing user accounts in the Psychological Services department. In additon, I provided support for technical issues related to software our psychologists used and created professional development videos training our psychologists on how to perform data analysis using district data systems to assist in writing psychoeducational reports.</p>
